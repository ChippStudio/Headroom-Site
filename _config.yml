# Meta tags optimisation
description: Headroom is your personal marketing assistant for your podcast show. Podcasting is the modern and, in many cases, the easiest way to share your knowledge, creativity, and express yourself. It is usually much easier for your audience to listen to a podcast instead of reading an article, although these two often go hand in hand. For creators, it is easier to record an audio podcast rather than a video format. However, it does not matter which option you choose. Whether you decide to write an article or record audio with or without video, it is just a matter of preference. The important thing is to tell the world about your show and promote each episode regularly.
