From the time when the idea was born, our mission and goal was to create the best and simple tool for podcasters. After couple attempts and many rebuilding and redesigns, we have finally found the concept what we are happy for. I happy to announce Headroom, the MacOS app for podcasters. With Headroom you can create podcasts, record episodes from idea to publishing. With the references on the industry leaders applications like Final Cut Pro and DaVinci Resolve we have developed Headroom with the same concepts in mind. This is because we split the application by several parts.

Scripting
On the early stage of episode we usually have only idea, and we need structure them and prepare topics, questions for interview or story. Create notes and do research, for create best story.

Recording
Podcasting is an audio format of story telling. With Headroom you can record main content, record some elements after in editing process.

Editing
Compile all elements in final episode. Background music, promotions or some nice audio transitions between chapters. Edit and fix recorded audio or recompile the whole story with easy to use audio ending tool. 

Transcription
As we mentioned before, podcasts are audio story telling format, but it does not mean that podcasters do not need to have text versions of episodes. It needed for SEO optimisation, additional distribution channels and etc

Podcast
Podcaster have to do a lot of routine TODOs with each episodes, fill meta information about show, mark chapters, fill show notes and more. Headroom allow podcaster automate most of all those jobs.

Publishing
After all work what was done, itâ€™s finally time to export the final result and publish for listeners. You can export all elements one by one and publish them later. Or upload and publish elements directly from Headroom.

This is only base principles Headroom is much bigger then those 6 elements, but it still simple tool for beginner and professionals podcaster.

Headroom will be available later this fall.
