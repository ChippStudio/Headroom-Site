**Audio as a product is absolutely brilliant.** It allows you to consume content in various environments—at home, at work, while exercising, or even driving. This versatility is likely why podcasts have become so popular. However, audio alone is not always enough. This is why we have included transcription capabilities in Headroom, among other features.

## Why is Audio Not Enough?

**Accessibility** and **audio analysis** are two key areas where audio falls short. Of these, accessibility is the most crucial. Unfortunately, we live in a world where not all potential listeners can fully enjoy audio content—some may have hearing difficulties. Providing a transcription as an article can make your content accessible to everyone.

From a technical standpoint, transcriptions are invaluable for generating show notes, chapters, and other content.

### Accessibility

Let’s start with accessibility. With Headroom, you can export a transcription as a ready-to-use article. You can also identify speakers in the transcription, which makes for a better article when converting interviews into text. Additionally, transcriptions can be used to create captions for videos. All of these features help you make your content more inclusive.

### Possibilities

In Headroom, transcription offers much more than just accessibility. It allows you to generate chapters, show notes, keywords for search optimization, and additional tools to enhance your post-production process.

### Another Important Point

There are many situations where your listeners might not be able to listen to your show—perhaps they’re in a noisy environment or simply prefer reading. By providing an article, your content remains available to them, no matter the circumstances.

### Whisper in Headroom

We use the powerful Whisper model to transcribe audio into text. This model supports transcription in over 100 languages and operates entirely on your device—no need to upload files or download results. You can create as many transcriptions as you need, with no limitations on minutes.

### Final Words

Transcription is an essential feature of Headroom, enabling us to automate many tasks and help you create the best show possible.
