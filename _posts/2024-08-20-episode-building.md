## Audio Editing Tool

At Headroom, our goal is to make podcast creation as effortless as possible. We want you to focus on your content, not the tools. One of the biggest challenges for new podcasters is editing. We understand the frustration that many feel when they first encounter audio editing software.

With this in mind, we began researching how to simplify the editing process. How can we eliminate unnecessary steps? How can we make editing more intuitive? Here’s what we’ve come up with so far.

## Essential Audio Editing Functions for Podcasters

We don’t aim to create a professional audio editor, but we do want to provide an editing toolchain in Headroom that meets the needs of podcasters. The challenge is to develop a powerful tool while keeping it as simple as possible.

Let’s start with the main features and terminology that form the foundation of Headroom’s editing capabilities.

### Multi-Track Support

As a podcaster, you often need to do more than just compile audio tracks. You might want to add background music, comments, or even ambient noise. Multi-track support allows you to easily layer and arrange these elements.

### Audio Segments and Actions

Within each track, you can add as many audio segments as you need. All the basic actions are available from day one:

- Copy, paste, and cut segments
	- Adjust segment positions
- Including start and end times
- Trim segments
- Merge segments if needed
- Adjust volume for individual segments or entire tracks
	- Fine-tune volume levels for more precision

### Audio Effects

Audio effects can change how your podcast sounds, adding drama, humor, or fixing issues in post-production. Here are the main effects available in Headroom:

- Fade In/Out transitions
- Reverb
- Compression
- Delay
- Pitch Shift
- Time Stretching
- Distortion/Overdrive
- Chorus
- Noise Reduction
- Flanger/Phaser
- Crossfade
- Normalization
- Reverse
- Echo
- Sidechain Compression

Not all of these effects are commonly used in podcasting, but they provide you with the flexibility to enhance your recordings as needed.

### Sound Library

We integrate with [Freesound](https://freesound.org/), allowing you to search for and add sound effects directly within Headroom. Just find the sound you need and drag it into your editing space.

## Easy to Use and Understand

As mentioned earlier, many rookie podcasters are surprised by how complicated audio editors can be. These tools often require you to understand a lot of technical details about audio. While it’s beneficial to know this eventually, when you're starting out, all you want to do is create and publish your show as quickly and easily as possible.

With this in mind, we’ve designed Headroom’s user interface and experience. You can drag and drop segments and effects, adjust timings, and see the results immediately. If you need to tweak a parameter in a track or effect, it’s as straightforward as using any app you’re familiar with. The interface is powerful yet simple.

## Not Just for Beginners

Headroom also supports more complex audio editing, like equalization, allowing you to fix recordings with just a few clicks. Our goal is to strike a balance between providing powerful tools and avoiding overly complicated interfaces.

## This Is Just the Beginning

We have big plans for this part of the app, but we don’t want to rush by adding features just for the sake of it. We value your feedback, so please reach out and let us know what you need. Your input is key to creating a great product.
