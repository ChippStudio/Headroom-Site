## Recording Environment: Essential Software and How Headroom Can Help

Recording is more than just speaking into a microphone. To achieve the best results, you need to consider factors beyond your content. While echo and background noise can be fixed in post-production, it's better to address these issues during recording.

#### Room Setup

Ensure your room is free from echo and external noise. While software can help, a well-prepared recording space leads to better sound quality from the start.

#### Hardware Considerations

The quality of your microphone, sound card, and mixers all contribute to your final audio. Investing in good hardware is key.

#### Software Support

The software you use to record and save your audio files also plays a vital role. This is where Headroom steps in, offering tools that go beyond simple recording.

## More Than Just Audio: Using Headroom for Scripting and Teleprompting

Recording isn't just about capturing sound; it's also about delivering your content effectively. Preparation is half the battle, and if you’ve created a script, you’ll want to use it during recording.

Headroom’s built-in teleprompter is designed to help you stay on track. 

**You can:**
- Read your script line by line
- Check information and notes while recording
- Mark important moments during the session
- 
The teleprompter is versatile, allowing you to adjust it based on your show’s needs. Whether you prefer a traditional teleprompter or just a few key notes.

**Headroom provides options for:**
- Showing or hiding section titles
- Displaying notes
- Adjusting reading speed
- and more

This flexibility ensures you’re fully equipped to deliver your best performance.

### Recording with Headroom
Headroom simplifies the recording process by allowing you to start, stop, pause, and save recordings in separate files. The app lets you select input and output sources directly, transforming your space into a professional recording studio.

Your recordings are continuously saved to your local disk, so even if something goes wrong—a power outage or technical glitch—you won’t lose your work.

### Focus Mode
