## Script Preparation for Different Podcast Styles

Not every podcast requires the same level of preparation. For some, a few notes with key thoughts suffice, while others need detailed scripts with questions for interviews or exact wording for storytelling. Headroom offers versatile scripting tools to suit any style, whether you're creating a casual chat or a meticulously structured narrative.

### Blocks, Templates, and AI

The core component of scripting in Headroom is the block. A block can contain different types of content, which are displayed in the teleprompter during recording. Depending on your needs, you can customize what information appears and how it's styled.

**Key Block Types**

**Title:** Marks the beginning of a section, such as an introduction or a main segment.

**Notes:** Provides additional context or reminders, perfect for interviews or complex topics.

**Content:** The primary text that appears on the teleprompter, such as dialogue or narrative content.
Templates

Above these styles [are templates](/blog/posts/templates-in-podcasts). You can create custom templates for any block type, making it easy to reuse content or formats with variables that can be quickly filled in. Just drag and drop the templates from the sidebar, and you're ready to go.

## AI Assistant

Leveraging advanced AI technology, Headroom can assist in generating scripts, correcting grammar, and ensuring consistency in style and structure. We're excited about our planned integration with Apple Intelligence and other leading AI solutions to provide you with the best possible experience.
