## Additional Level of Your Show for Listeners
Metadata in an MP3 file is a crucial part of making the listening process more comfortable for your audience. All major podcast players support most standards of ID3 tags. At Headroom, we also support the latest ID3 version 2.4 tags, which is the most reliable standard for podcasters.

## Tags in Headroom and More
In Headroom, you don't need to worry about specific tag names or technical details. All you need to do is fill in the information about your podcast (Tip: [use templates for this](/blog/posts/templates-in-podcasts)), add chapters, and provide a description (Tip: templates will also help here). After you export the final version of your episode, Headroom will embed all the tags inside the MP3 file.

### List of Tags
Tags within the file and podcast players can be split into two groups: podcast-related tags and episode-related tags.

**Podcast-Related Tags**

These tags are almost the same for all your episodes but are very important for marketing, search optimization, and listener comfort. With Headroom, you only need to fill in this information once, or if you already have a published show, simply insert the RSS link, and the app will parse all the necessary information.

**Here is the full list of podcast-related tags:**

- Title: The title of your show
- Artist
- Copyright
- Year
- Encoded By
- Publisher
- Performer
- Feed Link

**Episode and Navigation Tags**

Episode-related tags are particularly important as they help users quickly get information about the episode and navigate within it using chapters.

### Artwork, Title, and Show Notes

> A meaningful title and unique artwork will help your show stand out.

In the **title**, you may include the episode number and sometimes the show title, but this is not necessary.

**Artwork** is optional. By default, all players can use the artwork from your show. However, if you have a great idea for a unique and recognizable cover, go for it. In Headroom, you can easily spot episodes with custom artwork.

**Show notes** are a brief description of your episode. This section can also include your contact information, social media links, time codes for chapters, sponsorship information, and more. With Headroom's powerful templates, you only need to decide the order of these elements, and all the necessary information will be updated instantly.

Show notes are likely the first thing your listeners will see when they receive a notification about a new episode. Keep them short but informative.

### Chapters

**Chapters are special tags that contain additional details:**

**Title:** Each chapter should have a title to be easily recognizable by listeners.
**Artwork** (Optional): Many players display chapter artwork as a preview. This is an easy way to add visual information to your audio content.
**Link:** This is optional but useful if you want to provide additional information. (Tip: With Headroom, you can be confident that your links work correctly, thanks to our link preview feature.)
**Time Codes:** Of course, chapters include time codes for the start and end of each section. But don’t worry; with Headroom, managing time codes is easier than ever. Just set the start point, and Headroom will automatically adjust all time codes.
By using these features in Headroom, you can ensure your podcast is well-organized and accessible, enhancing the listening experience for your audience.
