Headroom Publisher is a tool designed to provide final and fine polishing to your podcast episodes with minimal effort on your part. Our goal is to create a tool where you can upload the audio of your show in any format and, with minimal actions, achieve a final result that is ready to publish.

Let's take more details tour through the Headroom

#### **How to Go From Raw Audio to Published Podcast in Minutes ‚Äî With Headroom**

Whether you‚Äôre an indie podcaster or a seasoned publisher, post-production can be a grind. Manually formatting metadata, generating show notes, converting audio, and organizing files‚Ä¶ it all adds up. That‚Äôs why we built **Headroom: Podcast Publisher** ‚Äî a native macOS app designed to automate and streamline your entire publishing workflow.

Let‚Äôs walk through how Headroom takes you from raw audio to a published, polished podcast in minutes ‚Äî no technical skills required, no internet needed.

## **One-Click Audio Import with Podcast Templates**

When you first launch Headroom, you‚Äôre greeted with a welcome screen that offers several options to start. The fastest way? **Import your audio using a podcast template**.

![Welcome Screen](/images/blog/posts/headroom_workflow_welcome_screen.png)

A template is more than a pre-filled form. It‚Äôs a shortcut to consistency and clarity:

- Automatically fills in your show‚Äôs metadata (title, author, publisher, etc.)
- Pulls in info from your RSS feed ‚Äî and keeps it synced
- Links to your export preferences, like audio format and show notes layout

You can create as many templates as you need ‚Äî one for each show, season, or format. Headroom lets you manage these templates from the settings, and even import/export them as JSON for team collaboration or backups.

Once imported, Headroom analyzes your audio, extracts chapters (if embedded), and prepares the file for transcription.

## **Instant Transcription ‚Äî Right on Your Mac**

Headroom uses an **on-device Whisper model**, which means your transcription happens locally, with no need for an internet connection. This makes the process:

![Transcription Progress](/images/blog/posts/headroom_workflow_transcription_progress.png)

- ‚ö° Fast ‚Äî transcribe an hour of audio in just a few minutes
- üîí Private ‚Äî your audio never leaves your machine
- ‚úÖ Reliable ‚Äî even if you‚Äôre offline or on the go

Transcription starts automatically by default (you can toggle this in settings). If you‚Äôve already downloaded the model, the process begins right after import.

## **Let the Headroom Assistant Do the Heavy Lifting**

Once the transcript is ready, it unlocks the real magic: **Headroom Assistant**.

Think of it as your post-production co-pilot. It can instantly generate:

### **Episode Metadata**

![Welcome Screen](/images/blog/posts/headroom_workflow_episode_assistant.png)

Based on your transcript, the Assistant proposes a **title**, **description**, and detailed **show notes**. You can prompt it to summarize the episode, make it more engaging, or even optimize for search engines. Need a punchier title? Just click *‚ÄúMake it sound like a headline.‚Äù*

### **Smart Show Notes with Templates**

![Welcome Screen](/images/blog/posts/headroom_workflow_show_notes_templates.png)

You can expand your show notes with **pre-written templates** ‚Äî like guest bios, sponsor blurbs, or standard episode outros. Headroom merges these seamlessly into your notes. Each template can be podcast-specific or universal.

### **Chapter Art & Episode Artwork**

![Welcome Screen](/images/blog/posts/headroom_workflow_image_playground.png)

Add compelling artwork to the episode or even individual chapters. Use existing assets, or experiment with AI-generated visuals using Apples‚Äôs Image Playground with Apple Intelligence.

### **Automatic Chapter Splits**

Let the Assistant identify chapter breaks and title each one. Chapters make your episodes easier to navigate on platforms like Apple Podcasts or Spotify, and they‚Äôre great for SEO too.

## **Final Setup: Metadata, Format, and Export**

Once everything‚Äôs filled in, it‚Äôs time to finalize your episode for export and publishing.

## **Publish with Confidence**

With a built-in publishing checklist and clear status indicators, you‚Äôll always know whether an episode is ready to go:

- **Not Ready** ‚Äî missing title, description, or show notes
- **Ready** ‚Äî all required fields complete
- **Published** ‚Äî already live in the RSS feed
